## Installation

Ensure that you're running Node v.6.x.0 or greater as well as have the latest npm release running in your local environment. Clone the repository down by typing `git clone https://github.com/churchie317/hangman.git`. Once downloaded, cd into the newly created repository and download the project's dependencies by typing `npm install`. Once the dependencies have finished installing, type `npm start` to build the application's bundle and start up the application's local server. You may be prompted to download some Elm dependencies. In that case simply press return to continue. Open up a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3333` to begin playing.

Enjoy!
